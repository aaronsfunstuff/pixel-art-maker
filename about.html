                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The idea for Pixel Art Creator started in 2022 when a group of friends noticed a lack of intuitive tools for pixel art creation. What began as a small side project quickly gained traction as we shared it with the community.</p>

                <p>After receiving positive feedback and seeing the potential to make a real impact, we decided to dedicate more time and resources to develop the platform further. Our team worked tirelessly to turn the initial concept into a fully-fledged application, incorporating features that users requested and refining the user experience.</p>

                <p>We officially launched Pixel Art Creator in early 2023 and have since continued to expand its features and capabilities, thanks to the support and enthusiasm of our user base.</p>
